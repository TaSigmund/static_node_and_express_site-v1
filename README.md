CSS changes:
I changed the css at the end of styles.css
I changed the color of the sidebar so it matches the content views.
I therefor had to change the h5 to black.
I changed the font-family of the headings so it matches the rest of the webpage ('Lato', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;)
I changed the box-shadow of the sidebar thumbnail so it matches the project thumbnails.
I also changed the background color of the links on the about page.
I added a thicker seperation line on the index page.
